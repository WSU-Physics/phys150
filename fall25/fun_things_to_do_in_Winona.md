There are lots of fun things to do in Winona.  Here's a short list:

- South East Minnesota is full of amazing trout streams.  The MN DNR has a [resource page with maps](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/trout/index.html). The closest streams to campus are [Garvin Brook](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kS5dTASksrcMZxjz5), [Gilmore Creek](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TQmXCN1Gr5FTkcAV9), [East Burns Valley Creek](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k5oZZEnXCym7CEfWA), and [Pleasant Valley Creek](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MT3xDR3qNfWsnhQ58).

  # Disc Golf in Winona

In Winona, there are three disc golf courses. One behind Saint Marry's University, one after the bridge across the lake when driving from the highway to Winona State, and one along the lake at the park by the Clinic and YMCA. 

Ranking these courses, number 1 goes to Saint Marry's, number 2 goes to the one by the Y, and dead last goes to the one by the bridge. 

Saint Marry's is scenic, serene, and offers an amazing blend of nature hiking and a fun and challenging course.

The lake side course offers a fun and challenging experience with many unique holes, and is located in the center of the town, so its not far from anywhere. 

Lastly, the one by the bridge is close to WSU, but is lacking in many features and is often plagued with overgrown grass, causing discs to be lost in the middle of the fairway, and is overall unintresting and featureless.
