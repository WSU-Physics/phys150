There are lots of fun things to do in Winona.  Here's a short list:
- Canoeing
- Hiking
- Ice skating

- South East Minnesota is full of amazing trout streams.  The MN DNR has a [resource page with maps](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/trout/index.html). The closest streams to campus are [Garvin Brook](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kS5dTASksrcMZxjz5), [Gilmore Creek](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TQmXCN1Gr5FTkcAV9), [East Burns Valley Creek](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k5oZZEnXCym7CEfWA), and [Pleasant Valley Creek](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MT3xDR3qNfWsnhQ58).
