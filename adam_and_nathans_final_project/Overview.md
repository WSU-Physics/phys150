## Background
Nathan had a all-sky camera in the backyard.  It would take pictures of the sky via a fish-eye lens. A Raspberry pi controls the camera.  The whole system lives in a PVC pipe and the camera looks at the sky via a clear polycarbonate dome. The system word fine during the summer months, but eventually the dome would frost (or dew) over and the sky images would be drgraded or unreadable.  Frost/dew makes the system unusable in colder months.

##  Problem statement:
1. Nathan does not want frost on his skycamera dome (mediocre)
2. Prevent moisture (on the skycamera dome) from degrading skycamera images. (better)

## Design Requirements: the system will...
1. will run on USB or 110AC electrical power
2. will not "brown out" the computer running the camera
3. will not overheat the assembly (PVC and polycarbonate)
4. will, along with the assembly, fit in a 3 or 4" PVC pipe
5. will work down to -30F
6. will not damage the plastic/polycarbonte dome
7. Nathan doesn't want to see frost or condensation on the dome (how can we quantify this?)
8. must be user servicable.
9. will not create reflections on the inside of the polycarbonate dome
