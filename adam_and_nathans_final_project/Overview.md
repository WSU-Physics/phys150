##Background
Nathan had a all-sky camera in the backyard.  It would take pictures of the sky via a fish-eye lens.

##  Problem statement:
1. Nathan does not want frost on his skycamera dome (mediocre)
2. Prevent moisture from degrading skycamera images. (better)

## Design Requirements:
1. run on USB or 110AC electrical power
2. Does not "brown out" the computer running the camera
3. system will not overheat the assembly (PVC and polycarbonate)
4. Needs to fit in a 3 or 4" PVC pipe
5. Works down to -30F
6. System can't damage the plastic/polycarbonte dome
7. Nathan doesn't want to see frost or condensation on the dome (how can we quantify this?)
8. must be user servicable.
